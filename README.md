### Groundwork Collaborative Chartbook

Repository for code related to the Groundwork Collaborative Chartbook

------

The Chartbook is a set of notes, including charts and tables, that update with new economic data. 

Underneath the hood:

* Python code that retrieves, standardizes, and stores data
* A LaTeX template that mixes pre-scripted text and placeholders for generated text
* Python code that converts data into words; e.g. -2.5847 -> “decreased 2.6 percent”
